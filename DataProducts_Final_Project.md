Project Requirements
========================================================

* Develop a shiny application to show case the ability to build data products. 
* The application needs to be interactive with some input fields and or buttons that perform some actions on the server and display the result back to the user.
* The server is also required to do some sort of calculations on a chosen set of data and display the results.
* Create a pitch presentation about the shyny application.

Data Used
========================================================

The diamonds data set available as part of ggplot2 R library is used in this application.This dataset has 53940 observations with 10 variables.


```r
library(ggplot2)
head(diamonds, n=4)
```

```

```

Analysis of Diamond Dataset
========================================================
This shyny application is a simple web application to analyze the variation of average diamond price with its properties. The side bar panel has the input controls and the main panel shows the results.
* Choose a Property - This is the diamond property type selector. Make your choice of property type here. 
* Choose a Property Value - Based on the selection of the property type above, this selection box will be populated with unique property values. Make your selection of the value here.
* Choose Number of Rows to View - Move the slider to select the number of rows to view.
* The main panel on the top right will show a plot of average prices grouped by another property type for the chosen property value. The main panel on the bottom right will show a table of diamonds data for the chosen property value. 
* Change slider to increase or decrease the number of rows to view.
